      <p>Hello everyone!</p>
      <p>
        I am currently working as a CRM Specialist with a focus on the Salesforce Marketing Cloud platform.
        In this role, I have gained valuable experience in creating and managing marketing campaigns,
        customer segmentation, and working with AMPScript along with other tools and technologies specific to SFMC.

        Previously, I worked as a QA tester in the IT department, where I acquired extensive knowledge in testing
        front-end applications. This experience helped me develop strong skills using tools like Jira and Postman API,
        as well as deepen my proficiency in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I am passionate about playing the tambura and I am proud to be a member of the band TS Bacchus.
        Alongside my professional responsibilities, I occasionally take on web development projects for clients,
        which helps me stay updated with the latest trends and sharpen my technical skills.
